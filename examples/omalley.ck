RBMA: What does your set-up look like? I assume it's quite different depending on
what group or what context you're in.

Stephen O'Malley: It used to be more so, but kind of on the point I just made,
it's kind of like you can change your tone with the same tools. It's like a
carpenter makes a lot of different things with his tools too. I use reverb, delay,
I love tape delays, and I have modded RAT pedals, and the most important thing in
my effects set-up is a switch that allows me to have four channels simultaneously
or individually, which has phase control on each channel so I can play several
amplifiers. The amplifiers don't have to be in phase with each other, or I can
tune the phase so they are all in phase and that makes an incredible difference
with tone, of course. That was a real game-changer, that piece of gear.
