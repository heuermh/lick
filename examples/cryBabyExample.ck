// Super-simple wah-wah pedal example
// by Perry R. Cook, October 2013
//     this one uses Chuggraph extension
// Based on Julius O. Smith's experiments
// with his own CryBaby.  See:
// https://ccrma.stanford.edu/realsimple/faust_strings/faust_strings.pdf

@import "../lick/effect/CryBaby"

// OK, now let's test this baby!!
SndBuf s => CryBaby myWah => dac;
"shuffle.wav" => s.read; // test guitar riff
1 => s.loop;

SinOsc autoWah => blackhole; // we use this to automatically
0.3 => autoWah.freq;         // open/close our wah-wah filter

while (1)  {  // just hang here and update
    0.5*(1.0+autoWah.last()) => myWah.setWah;
    0.01 :: second => now;
}
